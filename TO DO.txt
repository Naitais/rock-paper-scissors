NEXT

1) FIX PLAYER BUTTONS, THEY LOOK TERRIBLE.

2) WHENEVER A GAME ENDS, ACTUALLY RESET THE GAME! RESET THE VALUE OF ALL GAME VARIABLES.

3) ACTUALLY MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE WHEN A WINNER OF THE GAME IS DECIDED, SO THAT PLAYER NEEDS TO GO BACK TO MAIN MENU OR RESET OR WHATEVER, FIGURE IT OUT.

4) ADD FUNNY GIFS/SOUNDS WHEN GAME ENDS (ideally add some for when the player wins and then some for when the player loses, maybe make it random using an array or random number so that it is not always the same gif/sound).
